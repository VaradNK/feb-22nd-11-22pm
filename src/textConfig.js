We met, we talked, and you saw all my ups and downs — even my cry moments yeah…i guess that part is still funny for me:-) Honestly, I don’t even know what I’m trying to say right now maybe because I’ve already said so many things to you before & I don’t want to repeat them again. But there’s one thing that never changed for me — youuu!!! Every time you understood me, every time you explained things to me, every time you told me that everything would be okay — thank you so much for that! Even now, I don’t really know what else to say. I’m just a guy who loves you more than you imagine, more than you probably think!!! The thing I want to say is this: I’m always here for you, Rutuuu!! Always I know I say this 1000 times before this but hmm!! There’s so much more I want to say, but I’ve promised myself not to text or call you which is the most idiotic thing I say in my whole life:-(.....At the end truth is simple: If you’re happy, I’m happy!!`,
