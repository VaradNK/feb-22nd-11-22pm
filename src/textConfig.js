    letterMessage: `Yeah...it’s been one year… and honestly so much has happened in this time...We met, we talked, we shared so many thoughts...You saw my ups and downs… even my cry moments yeah, I guess that part is still funny for me now😅 Sometimes I sit and think about how all of this even happened... How we just started talking from that last year Feb 22nd 11:22pm text like Story chi poem chan ahe… yeah i still remember the date and even time (I know Idiot ahe me) and suddenly one year passed it feels unreal! Honestly, I don’t even know what I’m trying to say right now...maybe because I’ve already said so many things to you before, and I don’t want to repeat them again to bother your mind. But there’s one thing that never changed for me — youuu!!!🤍 Every time you understood me! Every time you explained things patiently when I was overthinking! Every time you told me that everything would be okay! Thank you...Thank you so much for that!!🌸 You don’t even realize how much that meant to me! There were days when my mind felt heavy, when I didn’t even understand myself… and somehow you did! You stayed calm when I was chaos! You stayed soft when I was stubborn! You stayed! And yeah… I joke about my cry moments now 😅 but the truth? I only allowed myself to be that vulnerable because it was you! I felt safe & I still do! Sometimes I replay our old chats those silly talks, those fights, those cute “ho-ho” messages!! The way you would explain things so maturely, the way you would handle me when I was being dramatic🥺 those little things they mean more than the big ones!!! Even now, I don’t really know what else to say... I just I just wanna say...idk ka ahe me asa...I’m just a guy who loves you more than you imagine… more than you probably think!!!🤍 The thing I want to say is simple: I’m always here for you, Rutuuu Always!!! I know I’ve said this 1000 times before… but some things are worth repeating and yes… I promised myself not to text or call you — which is honestly the most idiotic decision I’ve ever tried to make 😅 because when you love this deeply, silence feels heavier than words! There’s so much more I want to say. So much more I feel. But sometimes love isn’t about saying everything loudly...and I already said lot of things loudly I know veday me saglach agodr bolun baslo!😅 You changed me in ways you don’t even know...You made me more patient! More understanding! More emotional in a good way! And the truth is simple — If you’re happy, I’m happy!! If you’re peaceful, I’m okay!! If you’re smiling somewhere, that’s enough for me!!😊 I don’t know what the future holds....I don’t know where life will take us. But I do know this —  all these years(5), these memories, these feelings… they are REAL!!! And they’ll always stay special to me! And no matter what happens… there will always be one person who silently prays for your happiness, who loves you endlessly and yeah who carries a soft corner for you that will never disappear!!!🤍 And if someday you ever feel tired, confused, overwhelmed… just remember there’s one idiot who still believes in you more than anything...IM HERE!!!🌸`,

      "Well… I guess this is an ending of this code...I truly hope this little code, this small effort from my side, makes you smile even for a few seconds!😊 Because if it does, then everything was worth it!! There were so many things I wanted to wish to BAPPA with you....so many quiet prayers I never even said out loud...and today, I just want to say them honestly...Rutuuu...Can I be the poem… and not the poet? The admired… and not the admirer? The captured… and not the capturer? The written… and not the writer? The loved… and not the lover? Can I… for once in my life…be the wish and not the wisher? Be the yearn and not the yearner? I’ve lived so long being the one who feels more. The one who expresses more. The one who waits. The one who hopes. The one who loves a little louder than necessary! But just once… just once…Can I be the moon… and not the moonstruck?🌙 Not because I’m tired of loving you...But because loving you has always felt natural to me! Effortless! Real! Deep! ou’ve seen my strongest days!You’ve seen my weakest ones too! You've heard my overthinking! You’ve handled my emotions! You’ve calmed storms inside me that nobody even knew were happening! And maybe you don’t realize this… but you became a safe place for me naturally!! I never loved you halfway, I never cared about you casually...Everything I felt was pure is pure!! And even now… even in silence… even in distance… there’s still this quiet part of me that believes everything’s going to be alright between us!!! Because BAPPA ahe na aplya sobat!!!🧿✨ I don’t know how. I don’t know when. But somewhere inside me, hope still exists!!!! I’m eagerly hoping!!! I’m patiently waiting!!!⏳ Not in a desperate way… but in a peaceful way!! Like someone who knows what they feel and isn’t ashamed of it! I' m sorry if i said too much...when you read this and if your heart feels even 1% heavy… or soft… or confused… or emotional… just know that there’s one idiot here who never stopped wishing the BEST for you! And if ever in same random moment you feel like calling…or texting…or just hearing a familiar voice…I’ll be here!!! Not as pressure. Not as expectation. Just as someone who loves you quietly and truthfully!!!😊🧿"
